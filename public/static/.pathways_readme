Note: the "index.html" file in the pathways folder
is intentional. The idea is that it will ensure
consistent behavior between GitHub Pages and 
running the app locally with react-scripts.

The file should contain a JSON representation of
the list of filenames within the folder, 
not including index.html itself.
Yes it's a hack -- if we named it index.json, gh-pages will 
serve it when we GET the folder,
but react-scripts won't; instead it will serve up its
own list of files in the directory, including index.json.
